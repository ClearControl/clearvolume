ClearVolume is a real-time live 3D visualization library designed for high-end volumetric microscopes such as SPIM and DLSM microscopes. With ClearVolume you can see live on your screen the stacks acquired by your microscope instead of waiting for offline post-processing to give you an intuitive and comprehensive view on your data. The biologists can immediately decide whether a sample is worth imaging. 

ClearVolume can easily be integrated into existing Java, C/C++, Python, or LabVIEW based microscope software. Moreover, it has a dedicated interface to MicroManager/OpenSpim/OpenSpin control software. In addition, it offers the possibility of remote viewing of volume data
